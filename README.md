# 📌 Overview

Neuro-Optho AI is a multimodal deep learning framework developed for early cognitive risk assessment and neurodegenerative disease screening using retinal fundus images and brain MRI scans.

The system combines retinal disease detection, retinal vessel segmentation, retinal biomarker analytics, Alzheimer's disease classification, multimodal risk fusion, and explainable AI to generate a comprehensive cognitive risk score.

# 🤗 Model Hosting

Due to GitHub file size limitations, trained model weights are hosted on Hugging Face.

**Repository:**

https://huggingface.co/Avi-Valavoju/neuro-optho-models

The backend automatically downloads:

- 03_eye_glaucoma_classifier_efficientnet.pth
- 03_eye_vessel_unet.pth
- dr_final_messidor.keras
- alz_densenet_best.keras

No manual download is required.
